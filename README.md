## üìò Usage

### Generate a Walkthrough

To create a detailed walkthrough of your project's activities, use the following commands in the Rails console:

```ruby
rails console
> awanllm = WalkthroughAwanllm::AwanLLM.new
> awanllm.generate_walkthrough
```

If the above doesn't work, you can alternatively run:

```ruby
$ rails awanllm:generate_walkthrough
```

This generates a `walkthrough.md` file in your project's root directory.

You may modify the 'prompt' variable inside ./vendor/bundle/ruby/YOUR_VERSION/gems/walkthrough_awanllm-0.2.12/lib/walkthrough_awanllm.rb to mathc your custom way of creating walkthrough.md file
